Command for encrypting: java AES e [-length] [-mode] keyFile inputFile
Command for decryption: java AES d [-length] [-mode] keyFile encryptedinputFile

-length is an optional argument which denotes the keysize that the user intends to use for the AES cipher (128 or 256).
-mode is an optional argument which denotes the mode of operation which will be used for the AES cipher (ECB or CBC).

The default options are: -length 128, and -mode ECB.

Note: In order for a more secure encryption, it is recommended that you use CBC. To use CBC, you need to add an Initialization Vector to your key file
in a new line after the key, which is a 32-character length hex character.

Files that are encrypted will have the file name: [inputfilename].enc
For decrypted files: [encryptedfilename].dec

Format for input: A file with each line containing 32 hex characters (hence, 16 bytes on each line).

An example of such input:
